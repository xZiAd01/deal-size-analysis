Internship project: Deal size analysis and customer insights using Python &amp; Power BI.
# Customer Deal Size Analysis & Business Insights

This project was developed during my internship at **Abdul Latif Jameel – J-Analytics Department (2025)**.  
It focuses on analyzing **automotive sales data** to uncover patterns in deal sizes (Small / Medium / Large), customer purchasing behavior, and seasonal sales trends.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Data cleaning & feature engineering with Python (Jupyter Notebook).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify revenue drivers and customer patterns.
- Business KPIs defined and benchmarked against industry standards.
- Interactive **Power BI dashboard** for deal size monitoring and customer insights.
- Final business report summarizing findings and recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Documentation**: Jupyter Notebook + Internship Report

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers develop a dominant deal size preference (Small or Medium).
- Medium deals generate the largest share of total revenue (~$5.9M).
- Large deals are rare but have the highest per-order value.
- Sales peaks in Q4 are driven by more customers, not larger deals.
- Product lines like **Classic Cars** and **Trucks/Buses** outperform others.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning & analysis  
- `dashboard/` → Power BI file (`.pbix`) for interactive insights  
- `reports/` → Final report (PDF) with business context & recommendations  
- `data/` → (Optional) Sample dataset for demonstration  

## 📸 Demo

## 📌 Recommendations
- Invest in **customer retention** programs.  
- Encourage upselling from Small to Medium deals.  
- Leverage **Q4 peaks** with targeted campaigns.  
- Focus on high-performing product lines (Classic Cars, Trucks/Buses).
